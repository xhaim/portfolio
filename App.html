    <div>
      <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px">
        An expense tracker is a tool or application designed to help individuals
        monitor and manage their spending. It enables users to record their
        expenses by entering the necessary details, such as the amount spent,
        date, and a brief description. The tracker we've created specifically
        focuses on tracking expenses, providing a simple and efficient solution.
        With this app, users can click on the input area, which opens a form for
        entering expense information. Once entered, the expenses are displayed
        in a list view, allowing users to easily view and review their spending
        history. This straightforward interface facilitates quick expense
        logging and provides users with a clear overview of their expenditures.
        The primary purpose of the expense tracker is to promote financial
        awareness and encourage responsible spending habits. By consistently
        inputting their expenses into the list view, users can gain insights
        into their spending patterns, identify areas where they may be
        overspending, and make informed decisions about budgeting. Additionally,
        the ability to view and review the list of expenses helps users track
        their financial progress over time. While this expense tracker focuses
        solely on expense tracking, it serves as a valuable tool for individuals
        seeking to maintain better control over their finances and achieve their
        financial goals.

        The login/register form for the expense tracker app offers users a
        secure way to access their personal expense data. Existing users can log
        in by entering their credentials, while new users can register by
        providing essential information. Once registered, users will proceed to
        the home UI of the app, where they can start tracking their expenses.
        This streamlined process ensures a smooth transition from registration
        to the app's main interface, empowering users to take control of their
        financial management effortlessly.
